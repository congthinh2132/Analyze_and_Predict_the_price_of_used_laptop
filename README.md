# [PYTHON] Explore Used Laptop Price Data Collected from an E-commerce Website


## Introduction:
This project contains data i was crawled from the website neweeg, thats one of the most famous e-commerce website selling the used laptop. I will explore using Python on google colab.

## II. Requirement 
* Jupiter Notebook: Google Colab
* Programming Language: Python
* Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib


### Objective

The goal is to identify key features that affect the pricing of used laptops. By building a predictive model, we aim to estimate the price of a used laptop based on its specifications.

### Approach

The project followed a data-driven approach:

1. **Data Collection:**
    * Web scraping was used to gather data from a website. This data encompasses both structured (tabular) and unstructured formats.

2. **Data Processing and Analysis:**
    * Collected data underwent cleaning and processing to ensure its usability for modeling.
    * Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to discover patterns and relationships within the data.
    * Build Dashboard to visualize with Power BI

3. **Model Development:**
    * Several machine learning models were developed to predict laptop prices, including:
        * Linear Regression
        * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        * Random Forest Regression
